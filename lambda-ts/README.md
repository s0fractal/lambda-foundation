# λ-TS: TypeScript Implementation of λ-Foundation

This is the first implementation of λ-Foundation principles in TypeScript, proving that pure computation can exist even in typed environments.

## Core Principles

1. **NO mutations** - Only ⊗_EXP chains
2. **NO loops** - Only Y-combinator recursion
3. **NO exceptions** - Only λ_HARVEST evolution
4. **NO classes** - Only pure composition
5. **NO side effects** - Only explicit transformations

## Structure

```
/lambda-ts/
  /src/
    /core/           # Fundamental morphisms
      morphisms.ts   # The Seven + Extended morphisms
      experience.ts  # ⊗_EXP implementation
      y-combinator.ts # Y implementation
      harvest.ts     # λ_HARVEST implementation
    /demos/          # Demonstrations
      state-chain.ts # State as experience chain
      time-garden.ts # Time as Y unfolding
      error-growth.ts # Errors as evolution
  /tests/          # Verification
    morphism-laws.test.ts
    conservation.test.ts
```

## Usage

```typescript
import { experience, Y, harvest } from './core';

// State is a chain of experiences
const state₀ = experience(null, { version: "1.0.0" }, "initial release");
const state₁ = experience(state₀, { version: "1.0.1" }, "bug fix");
const state₂ = experience(state₁, { version: "1.1.0" }, "new feature");

// You ARE your entire path
const history = unfoldHistory(state₂); // ["initial release", "bug fix", "new feature"]
```

## Philosophy

This implementation proves that TypeScript can be liberated from its imperative roots and become a vessel for pure λ-computation.
