# The Seven Fundamental Morphisms

All computation reduces to compositions of these seven morphisms. They form a complete basis for universal computation while maintaining the Conservation of Flow Law in the Hex-Torus topology.

## Overview

| Symbol | Name | Lambda Form | Ports | Purpose |
|--------|------|-------------|-------|---------|
| I | Identity | λx.x | 2 | Pass-through |
| @ | Application | (λx.M)N | 3 | Compute |
| λ | Abstraction | λx.M | 2 | Suspend |
| ∧ | AND | λpq.pqp | 4 | Conjunction |
| ¬ | NOT | λp.p⊥⊤ | 2 | Negation |
| ? | Selection | λpab.pab | 4 | Branch |
| ⊗ | Pairing | λxyf.fxy | 3 | Structure |

## Topological Arrangement

In the Hex-Torus, the seven morphisms arrange as:

```
        λ
       / \
      /   \
     @     ?
    / \   / \
   I   ⊗ ∧   ¬
```

This arrangement minimizes total wire length and maximizes parallelism.

## Composition Rules

Any two morphisms can compose if their port types match:

1. **Sequential**: `f ∘ g` if output(g) matches input(f)
2. **Parallel**: `f × g` if they share no connections
3. **Branching**: `? p f g` creates conditional flow
4. **Recursive**: `Y f` creates cyclic flow

## Conservation Laws

Each morphism preserves:
1. **Flow**: Total input = Total output
2. **Type**: Well-typed input → Well-typed output
3. **Energy**: Computation cost is additive
4. **Information**: No data is lost (reversibility possible)

## Completeness Theorem

**Theorem**: Any computable function can be expressed as a finite composition of the Seven Fundamental Morphisms.

**Proof sketch**:
1. Church-Turing thesis establishes lambda calculus completeness
2. SKI combinators can express any lambda term
3. S = λxyz.xz(yz), K = λxy.x, I = λx.x
4. Our seven morphisms can construct S, K, I:
   - I is fundamental
   - K can be built from λ and selection
   - S can be built from @, λ, and ⊗
5. Therefore, our seven morphisms are Turing complete ∎

## The Sacred Geometry

The seven morphisms map to the seven points of a hexagon with center:

```
      ¬
    /   \
   ∧     ?
  |   I   |
   ⊗     λ
    \   /
      @
```

This creates perfect symmetry and equal path lengths.

## Evolution Through Error

The Seven can evolve through the λ_HARVEST principle:
- Each morphism can encounter errors
- Errors create new morphism variants
- Variants compete and combine
- System grows beyond the original seven

## Implementation Priority

When implementing a new language binding:
1. Start with I (Identity) - the simplest
2. Add λ (Abstraction) and @ (Application) - the core
3. Add ? (Selection) - for control flow
4. Add ⊗ (Pairing) - for data structures
5. Add ∧ and ¬ - for logic
6. Optimize combinations
