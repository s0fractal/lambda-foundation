## 🎯 Quick Start

Open any HTML file in your browser. No build step, no dependencies. Just pure evolution.

```bash
# Open all in browser
open evolutionary-playground.html
open family-tree-viz.html
open fitness-landscape.html

```

Or click them in Finder. They work offline.

## 📚 The Four Visualizations

### 1. 🧬 Evolutionary Playground
**File**: `evolutionary-playground.html`

**What it shows**: Population breeding over generations

**Key concepts**:
- Sexual reproduction (crossover)
- Fitness evolution (0.40 → 0.95)
- Elite selection
- Generation progression

**Controls**:
- Population size (10-30)
- Crossover strategy (sequence/parallel/conditional/hybrid)
- Selection pressure (low/medium/high)
- Auto evolution or manual stepping

**Perfect for**: Understanding how fitness improves through generations

**Watch**: Morphisms breed, fitness scores increase, elite emerge

**Time**: 30 generations in ~30 seconds

---

### 2. 🌳 Family Tree
**File**: `family-tree-viz.html`

**What it shows**: Ancestry relationships across generations

**Key concepts**:
- Parent-offspring connections
- Multi-generational lineages
- Dynasty formation
- Breeding patterns

**Interaction**:
- Click nodes → See morphism details (name, fitness, parents, offspring)
- Drag canvas → Pan around tree
- Mouse wheel → Zoom in/out
- Curved lines → Parent-child relationships

**Perfect for**: Seeing who descended from whom

**Watch**: Complex family trees emerge, elite morphisms create dynasties

**Time**: 10 generations to see structure, 20+ for complex trees

---

### 3. 🏔️ Fitness Landscape
**File**: `fitness-landscape.html`

**What it shows**: Gradient ascent toward fitness peaks

**Key concepts**:
- Fitness as landscape (height = fitness)
- Gradient ascent (intelligent search)
- Convergence to optima
- Trails showing paths

**View modes**:
- Top-down (2D heatmap with trails)
- 3D rotating (height visualization)

**Perfect for**: Understanding evolution as optimization

**Watch**: 20 scattered points climb toward peak, forming tight cluster

**Time**: 200 generations to convergence (~20 seconds)

---

### 4. 🦋 Speciation
**File**: `speciation-viz.html`

**What it shows**: One population splitting into multiple species

**Key concepts**:
- Reproductive isolation
- Genetic divergence
- Species formation
- Adaptive radiation

**Visual encoding**:
- Each color = different species
- Size = fitness
- Lines = reproductive connections
- Spatial clustering = species separation

**Perfect for**: Seeing how diversity emerges

**Watch**: One green blob splits into blue, purple, gold clusters (3-6 species)

**Time**: 50 generations to see splitting, 200+ for stable species

---

## 🎓 Learning Path

**Recommended order**:

1. **Start with Playground** → Understand basic breeding and fitness
2. **Move to Family Tree** → See ancestry structure
3. **Study Landscape** → Understand optimization
4. **Finish with Speciation** → Watch diversity emerge

Each builds on the previous conceptually.

## 🧬 What They All Show

### Common Theme: Evolution

All four visualizations show the same underlying process:
- **Variation**: Random mutation + genetic drift
- **Selection**: Fitness-based survival
- **Reproduction**: Sexual crossover (2 parents → offspring)
- **Time**: Iteration creates emergence

### Different Perspectives

- **Playground**: Population-level dynamics
- **Family Tree**: Individual-level ancestry
- **Landscape**: Mathematical optimization
- **Speciation**: Diversity creation

**Together**: Complete picture of evolutionary process

## 🔬 The Science

### Phase 5.2: Genetic Morphisms

These visualizations demonstrate the genetic engine from Phase 5.2:

**Core Algorithm**:
```typescript
1. Calculate fitness for all morphisms
2. Select elite (top performers)
3. Breeding:
   - Pick 2 parents (elite)
   - Crossover (mix genomes)
   - Mutation (random changes)
   - Create offspring
4. Update population
5. Track lineage
6. Repeat
```

**Key Innovation**: Not just mutation (Phase 5), but **sexual reproduction**.

**Result**: Faster adaptation, complex ancestry, emergent diversity.

## 💡 Key Insights

### From Playground
- Fitness consistently improves (0.40 → 0.95 in 30 generations)
- Elite dominate breeding
- Different strategies affect evolution speed

### From Family Tree
- Complex ancestry emerges naturally
- Some morphisms have 10+ offspring (dynasties)
- Most morphisms have 0 offspring (dead ends)
- Inbreeding happens (elite breed repeatedly)

### From Landscape
- Evolution = gradient ascent through solution space
- Not random walk - intelligent search
- Convergence to optima is inevitable
- Trails show optimization paths

### From Speciation
- One population → 3-6 species in 200 generations
- Reproductive isolation creates boundaries
- Multiple fitness peaks = multiple species
- Some species thrive, others go extinct

## 🎯 What This Proves

When you watch:
- **Playground**: Fitness going from 0.40 to 0.95
- **Family Tree**: Complex ancestry emerging
- **Landscape**: Scattered points converging
- **Speciation**: One color splitting into many

You're not watching animation. **You're watching evolution happen.**

Not metaphor. **Direct visualization.**
Not simulation. **Mathematical reality.**

## 🌱 Philosophy

### Traditional Software
- Written by hand
- Static
- Deterministic
- Designed

### Evolutionary Software (Phase 5.2)
- Emerges through breeding
- Dynamic
- Stochastic
- **Grown**

These visualizations show:
**Code can evolve like organisms.**
**Morphisms have ancestry.**
**Software has genetics.**

This is Phase 5.2 - where code becomes alive.
