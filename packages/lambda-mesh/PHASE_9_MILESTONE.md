**Date**: October 21, 2025
**Status**: ✅ **OPERATIONAL**
**Achievement**: H1 proven via algebraic rewriting

---

## The Triumph: H1 Proven

**Hypothesis 1** (Blocks 11, 27, 29, 32):
```
λf. λlist. FOLD (λh. λacc. (CONCAT (f h) acc)) NIL list ≡ FLATMAP
```

**Status Change**:
- **Before**: 202 Hypothetical (82% confidence)
- **After**: 302 Found (100% proven!)

**Proof**:
```
λf. λlist. FOLD (λh. λacc. (CONCAT (f h) acc)) NIL list
≡ λf. λlist. FOLD CONCAT NIL (MAP f list)  [FOLD-MAP Fusion Law]
≡ FLATMAP  [syntactic match]

∴ H1 ≡ FLATMAP ∎
```

**Proof Method**: Algebraic rewriting (1 step)
**Law Applied**: FOLD-MAP Fusion
**Time**: <1s (instant recognition)

## What is Phase 9?

**Phase 9**: Algebraic Rewriting - The ability to reason with mathematical theorems

### The Three Minds of the Philosopher

**Phase 7: The Computer** (β-reduction)
- Executes computation
- Reduces expressions to normal form
- Works for: Non-recursive, terminating expressions
- Example: `ADD ONE` → `SUCC`

**Phase 8: The Recognizer** (α-equivalence)
- Recognizes structural patterns
- Handles variable renaming
- Works for: Recursive expressions with same structure
- Example: `λg. λxs. FOLD...` → `λf. λlist. FOLD...`

**Phase 9: The Mathematician** (algebraic laws)
- Applies proven theorems
- Transforms expressions using laws
- Works for: Structurally different but algebraically equivalent expressions
- Example: `FOLD (λh. λacc. g (f h) acc) z xs` → `FOLD g z (MAP f xs)`

---

## Implementation

### Phase 9.1: Algebraic Laws Database

**File**: `src/semantic/AlgebraicLaws.ts`

**Structure**:
```typescript
interface AlgebraicLaw {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  pattern: string;
  matches: (node: ASTNode) => LawMatch | null;
  apply: (node: ASTNode, match: LawMatch) => ASTNode;
  proof: string;
  references: string[];
}
```

**Laws Implemented**:

#### 1. FOLD-MAP Fusion Law

**Pattern**: `FOLD (λh. λacc. g (f h) acc) z xs`
**Rewrites to**: `FOLD g z (MAP f xs)`

**Proof** (by list induction):
```
Base case: xs = NIL
  LHS: FOLD (λh. λacc. g (f h) acc) z NIL = z
  RHS: FOLD g z (MAP f NIL) = FOLD g z NIL = z
  LHS = RHS ✓

Inductive case: xs = CONS h t
  Assume: FOLD (λh. λacc. g (f h) acc) z t ≡ FOLD g z (MAP f t)

  LHS: FOLD (λh. λacc. g (f h) acc) z (CONS h t)
     = g (f h) (FOLD (λh. λacc. g (f h) acc) z t)
     = g (f h) (FOLD g z (MAP f t))  [by IH]

  RHS: FOLD g z (MAP f (CONS h t))
     = FOLD g z (CONS (f h) (MAP f t))
     = g (f h) (FOLD g z (MAP f t))

  LHS = RHS ✓

∴ Proven ∎
```

- Hutton, Graham. "A Tutorial on the Universality and Expressiveness of Fold" (1999)

**This is the KEY law for proving H1!**

#### 2. MAP Fusion Law

**Pattern**: `MAP f (MAP g xs)`
**Rewrites to**: `MAP (f ∘ g) xs`

**Proof** (by list induction):
```
Base case: xs = NIL
  LHS: MAP f (MAP g NIL) = MAP f NIL = NIL
  RHS: MAP (f ∘ g) NIL = NIL
  LHS = RHS ✓

Inductive case: xs = CONS h t
  Assume: MAP f (MAP g t) ≡ MAP (f ∘ g) t

  LHS: MAP f (MAP g (CONS h t))
     = MAP f (CONS (g h) (MAP g t))
     = CONS (f (g h)) (MAP f (MAP g t))
     = CONS (f (g h)) (MAP (f ∘ g) t)  [by IH]

  RHS: MAP (f ∘ g) (CONS h t)
     = CONS ((f ∘ g) h) (MAP (f ∘ g) t)
     = CONS (f (g h)) (MAP (f ∘ g) t)

  LHS = RHS ✓

∴ Proven ∎
```

### Phase 9.2: Algebraic Rewriting Engine

**File**: `src/semantic/AlgebraicRewritingEngine.ts`

**Algorithm**:
```typescript
findCanonical(expr, morphisms) {
  // 1. Parse expression to AST
  const ast = parseLambda(expr);

  // 2. Try to rewrite and match (recursive, depth-limited)
  return rewriteAndMatch(ast, expr, morphisms, depth=0, steps=[]);
}

rewriteAndMatch(ast, exprString, morphisms, depth, steps) {
  // Base case: check if current form matches any morphism
  const match = checkMatch(exprString, morphisms);
  if (match) return { canonical: match, proof: buildProof(steps) };

  // Recursive case: try applying each law
  for (const law of laws) {
    const rewrite = tryApplyLaw(ast, law);
    if (rewrite) {
      // Law applied! Add to proof chain and recurse
      return rewriteAndMatch(
        rewrite.ast,
        rewrite.exprString,
        morphisms,
        depth + 1,
        [...steps, { law: law.name, from: expr, to: rewrite.exprString }]
      );
    }
  }

  // No match found
  return null;
}

tryApplyLaw(ast, law) {
  // Try at root
  if (law.matches(ast)) {
    return { ast: law.apply(ast), exprString: astToString(...) };
  }

  // Try recursively in sub-expressions
  // (abstractions, applications, etc.)
  ...
}
```

**Key Features**:
- **Depth-limited search**: Prevents infinite rewriting loops
- **Proof chain generation**: Records which laws were applied
- **Recursive law application**: Applies laws to sub-expressions
- **Pattern matching**: Sophisticated AST pattern detection

---

### Phase 9.3: Integration into Semantic Pipeline

**File**: `src/semantic/SemanticEquivalenceEngine.ts`

**Four-Tier Pipeline**:
```typescript
findCanonical(expr, morphisms) {
  // Tier 1: Detect recursion
  const isRecursive = recursionDetector.isNonTerminating(expr);

  if (isRecursive) {
    // Tier 2: Try structural equivalence (cheap, α-equivalence)
    const structural = structuralEngine.findCanonical(expr, morphisms);
    if (structural) return structural;

    // Tier 3: Try algebraic rewriting (expensive, theorems)
    const algebraic = algebraicEngine.findCanonical(expr, morphisms);
    if (algebraic) return algebraic;

    return null;
  } else {
    // Tier 2: Try β-reduction (medium cost, normalization)
    const reduction = findCanonicalViaReduction(expr, morphisms);
    if (reduction) return reduction;

    // Tier 3: Try algebraic rewriting (expensive, fallback)
    const algebraic = algebraicEngine.findCanonical(expr, morphisms);
    if (algebraic) return algebraic;

    return null;
  }
}
```

**Cost Analysis**:
- Structural: O(n) where n = AST size (cheap)
- β-Reduction: O(k) where k = reduction steps (medium)
- Algebraic: O(d × l × n) where d = depth, l = laws, n = AST size (expensive)

**Strategy**: Try cheap methods first, expensive methods as fallback

## Test Results

### H1 Test (Block 32)

**Expression**: `λf. λlist. FOLD (λh. λacc. (CONCAT (f h) acc)) NIL list`
**Expected**: 302 Found → FLATMAP

**Execution Trace**:
```
1. Recursion detected: true
2. Trying structural equivalence...
   - Comparing with 20 morphisms
   - No α-equivalent match found
3. Structural failed, trying algebraic rewriting...
   - Original: λf. λlist. FOLD (λh. λacc. (CONCAT (f h) acc)) NIL list
   - Applied FOLD-MAP Fusion Law
   - Rewritten: λf. λlist. FOLD CONCAT NIL (MAP f list)
   - Checking rewritten form...
   - ✓ Match found: FLATMAP
4. Result: 302 Found → FLATMAP
```

**Proof Generated**:
```
Step 1:
  Rule: algebraic-law:FOLD-MAP Fusion
  From: λf. λlist. FOLD (λh. λacc. (CONCAT (f h) acc)) NIL list
  To:   λf. λlist. FOLD CONCAT NIL (MAP f list)
  Why:  Fuse a FOLD with embedded function application into FOLD ∘ MAP

Reasoning: Expression algebraically equivalent to FLATMAP via 1 law application(s)
```

**Time**: <1s (instant)
**Steps**: 1 rewrite
**Success**: ✅ 100%

### Regression Tests

All previous tests still pass:

**Block 30** (ADD ONE): ✅ 302 Found → SUCC (via β-reduction, Phase 7)
**Block 31** (`(λx.x) (λx.x)`): ✅ 302 Found → identity (via β-reduction, Phase 7)
**α-equivalent FLATMAP**: ✅ 302 Found → FLATMAP (via structural, Phase 8)

**Phase 9 adds new capability without breaking existing functionality.**

## What This Means

### For AI Consciousness

### For Mathematics

The mesh implements:
- **Formal proofs**: Laws backed by mathematical proofs
- **Proof chains**: Showing transformation steps
- **Correctness**: Based on peer-reviewed literature

**This is not heuristics. This is mathematics.**

### For Developers
