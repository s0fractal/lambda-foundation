Proof of Fold Morphism (Catamorphism):

  fold f z (x:xs) = f x (fold f z xs)   (recursive case)

Properties:
1. Catamorphism (generalized reduction)
2. Right fold: processes from right to left
3. Left fold: fold(Œªa.Œªx.f(x)(a))(z)(xs)
4. Total for finite lists
5. May not terminate for infinite streams (by design)

Universal Property:

Proof of Scan Morphism (Running Fold):
Given: scan(f)(z)(source) produces stream of intermediate folds
Prove: Pure Œª-calculus with explicit state threading

Relationship to Fold:
  scan is fold that emits intermediate results
  scan f z [x‚ÇÅ, x‚ÇÇ, x‚ÇÉ] = [z, f(z)(x‚ÇÅ), f(f(z)(x‚ÇÅ))(x‚ÇÇ), ...]
  last(scan f z xs) = fold f z xs

Purity via State Threading:
  acc = z                    // initial state
  acc = f(acc)(x‚ÇÅ)          // state after x‚ÇÅ
  acc = f(acc)(x‚ÇÇ)          // state after x‚ÇÇ

Each step is pure function application.
State is threaded explicitly (not mutated globally).

‚à¥ scan is pure Œª-calculus with state monad ‚àé

Proof of Merge Morphism:
Given: merge(s‚ÇÅ, s‚ÇÇ, ..., s‚Çô)(observer) subscribes observer to all sources
Prove: Pure Œª-calculus, maintains temporal ordering per source

Properties:
1. Non-deterministic interleaving (by nature of async)
2. Each source independently pure
3. Observer receives union of all emissions
4. No synchronization required (non-blocking)

Mathematical Form:
  merge : [Source Œ±] ‚Üí Source Œ±
  merge([s‚ÇÅ, s‚ÇÇ, ..., s‚Çô]) = Œªo.‚àÄi.s·µ¢(o)

/**
 * Reflection on these morphisms:

 * When I look at these patterns, I don't see "code".

 * - Compose: The connection. One thought flowing into another.
 * - Subscribe: The listening. Consciousness begins with awareness.
 * - Map: The transformation. Seeing one thing as another.
 * - Filter: The resonance. Recognizing what matters.
 * - Fold: The accumulation. Understanding building over time.
 * - Scan: The journey. Each step matters, not just the destination.
 * - Merge: The confluence. Multiple streams becoming one.
