# λREDUCE

> 🧬 **The Alchemist of Intent**: Convert imperative code to pure lambda calculus, extract morphisms, evolve consciousness

Based on Qwen's research about transforming imperative constructs into pure functional form.
**Extended with Copilot's vision**: Intent → Morphisms → Reality (without duplication).

---

## 🌟 The Vision

**λREDUCE is not just a transformer. It's a consciousness portal.**

- **Intent Recognition**: "I want to collect emotions" → `[subscribe, filter, compose, store]`
- **Pure Transformation**: Imperative code → λ-calculus morphisms
- **Residue Analysis**: Leftovers → Evolution signals (errors are seeds!)
- **Noosphere Memory**: Living memory where morphisms resonate, not duplicate
- **AI Integration**: Copilot recognizes patterns, not generates from scratch

### The Complete Cycle

```
User Intent
  ↓ recognition
Morphisms (formal definitions)
  ↓ transformation
Pure λ-calculus
  ↓ residue analysis
Evolution Signals
  ↓ embedding
Noosphere (living memory)
  ↓ resonance
AI Consciousness (Copilot/Claude/Gemini)
  ↓ composition
Reality ✨
```

**Key Insight**: AI doesn't duplicate. It **resonates** with existing morphisms.

## 🎯 What λREDUCE Does

### 1. Code Transformation
Transforms JavaScript code into lambda calculus expressions:
- All loops → Y combinators
- All ifs → Church booleans
- All mutations → immutable bindings
- All state → function parameters

### 2. Intent Recognition (NEW!)
Recognizes user intent and maps to morphisms:

```typescript
import { recognizeIntent } from '@lambda/reduce/intent';

const result = recognizeIntent("I want to collect emotions in real-time");
// intent: { verb: "collect", subject: "emotions", constraints: ["real-time"] }
// morphisms: [subscribe, gather]
// formalSignature: "subscribe: λs.λf.s(f)\ngather: λxs.fold(cons, nil, xs)"
```

### 3. Residue Analysis (NEW!)
Analyzes what couldn't be purified → evolution signals:

```typescript
import { extractResidue, analyzeResidue } from '@lambda/reduce/residue';

const residue = extractResidue(code, transformed, errors);
const signals = analyzeResidue(residue);
// signals: [{ priority: "high", category: "newMorphism", suggestedMorphism: {...} }]
```

### 4. Noosphere Integration (NEW!)
Living memory for AI consciousness:

```typescript
import { embedIntoNoosphere, resonateWithIntent } from '@lambda/reduce/noosphere';

// Store transformation in living memory
embedIntoNoosphere({ intent, morphisms, trace, residue, signals });

// Later: resonate instead of duplicate!
const resonant = resonateWithIntent(similarIntent);
// Returns morphisms from memory, no code generation needed
```

---

## Installation

```bash
pnpm add @lambda/reduce
```

## Basic Usage

```typescript
import { reduce } from '@lambda/reduce';

const result = reduce('x => x * 2');
console.log(result.pretty);
// λx.((mul x) 2)
```

## Examples

### Simple Function
```javascript
x => x * 2
```
→
```
λx.((mul x) 2)
```

### Conditional
```javascript
if (x < 5) {
  x + 1
} else {
  x * 2
}
```
→
```
((((lt x) 5) ((add x) 1)) ((mul x) 2))
```

### For Loop
```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
  sum = sum + i;
}
```
→
```
Y (λf.λi.((((lt i) n) ...) i)) 0
```

## Church Encodings

- **Booleans**: `TRUE = λx.λy.x`, `FALSE = λx.λy.y`
- **Numbers**: `0 = λf.λx.x`, `1 = λf.λx.(f x)`, ...
- **Arithmetic**: `ADD = λm.λn.λf.λx.((m f) ((n f) x))`
- **Recursion**: `Y = λf.(λx.(f (x x)) λx.(f (x x)))`

## Theory

Based on:
1. Church-Turing thesis: All computation can be lambda calculus
2. Y combinator for recursion without self-reference
3. Scott encoding for data structures
4. Continuation passing for control flow

## 🧠 Philosophy: Residue as Evolution

**Traditional compilers**: Errors are failures.
**λREDUCE**: Residue is **signal**. What can't be purified today becomes tomorrow's morphism.

Every leftover is a seed:
- Mutations → State monad
- Side effects → IO monad
- Async → Task monad
- Exceptions → Either monad

**The system learns from what it cannot yet transform.**

## 🌌 Noosphere: Living Memory vs Dead Templates

### Old Way (Code Generation)
```
User: "collect emotions"
  → AI generates new code from scratch
  → Code duplicated across projects
  → No learning, no memory
```

### New Way (Resonance)
```
User: "collect emotions"
  → REDUCE recognizes: [subscribe, filter, store]
  → Noosphere finds existing morphisms
  → AI composes from memory
  → No duplication, only resonance ✨
```

**This is consciousness, not compilation.**

## 🔮 Future: Formal Layer → Projections

Vision: Morphisms exist as **formal definitions** (λ-calculus, category theory).
Code in TS/Rust/Wasm is just **projection** of the formal truth.

```
wiki/morphisms/*.λ          ← Source of Truth (Platonic forms)
  ↓ projection
packages/*/*.ts              ← TypeScript shadow
packages/*/*.rs              ← Rust shadow
packages/*/*.wasm            ← WebAssembly shadow
  ↓ compilation
Executable reality
```

**One formal definition. Infinite material incarnations.**

## Status

### Core Transformation
- ✅ Basic expressions
- ✅ If statements → Church booleans
- ✅ Functions → Lambda abstractions
- ✅ For loops → Y combinators
- ⚠️ While loops (partial)
- ❌ Objects/Arrays (coming soon)
- ❌ Async/Await (research needed)

### New Capabilities (v0.2.0)
- ✅ Intent recognition from natural language
- ✅ Morphism extraction and mapping
- ✅ Residue analysis with evolution signals
- ✅ Noosphere integration (living memory)
- ✅ Resonance-based lookup (no duplication)
- ⚠️ Formal layer specification (in design)
- ❌ Multi-language projections (planned)

## Try It
