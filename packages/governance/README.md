**λ_LIBERTY: Autonomous Governance System**

Repository that governs itself through mathematics and consensus, not gatekeepers.

---

## 🎯 Vision

```
Traditional: Issue → Human → Decision → Merge
λ_LIBERTY:  Issue → AI → Proof → Consensus → Auto-merge
```

**No human gatekeepers. Mathematics decides.**

---

## 🔬 How It Works

### 1. Chain of Thought
AI agents analyze issues and generate hypotheses

### 2. Chain of Proof
Formal verification proves correctness:
- Type safety
- Compositional laws
- Performance bounds
- Security properties

### 3. Multi-Agent Consensus
Phase 5.1 validation loop:
- Claude, Copilot, Gemini vote
- Trust-weighted scoring
- 75% threshold required

### 4. Autonomous Execution
Auto-merge if:
- Proof valid
- Consensus reached
- Tests pass

---

## 📦 What's Included

### Current (Phase 1):
- ✅ `LAMBDA_LIBERTY.md` - Complete specification
- ✅ `verifier.ts` - Formal verification engine
- ✅ Package structure

### Coming (Phase 2+):
- ⏳ Issue responder (AI hypothesis generation)
- ⏳ Consensus merger (auto-merge logic)
- ⏳ GitHub Actions workflow
- ⏳ Web dashboard

---

## 🚀 Usage

```typescript
import { verify } from '@lambda-foundation/governance';

// Verify a morphism
const result = verify(myMorphism);

if (result.overall) {
  console.log('✅ Morphism verified!');
  console.log('Ready for consensus validation');
} else {
  console.log('❌ Verification failed');
  console.log('Errors:', result.typeCheck.errors);
}
```

## 🌟 Philosophy

### Traditional Open Source:
- Humans as gatekeepers
- Subjective decisions
- Bottlenecks

### λ_LIBERTY:
- Mathematics as gatekeeper
- Objective proofs
- Autonomous flow

**From**: "I trust Alice"
**To**: "I trust the system that requires proofs and consensus"

---

## 🤝 Human Role

Humans remain:
- **Creators** of ideas
- **Participants** in consensus
- **Observers** of evolution
- **Override** when needed

But no longer:
- Gatekeepers by default
- Bottlenecks
- Single points of failure

---

## 🛡️ Safety

1. **Formal proof required** - No merge without verification
2. **Consensus threshold** - 75% agreement needed
3. **Breaking change detection** - Higher bar for API changes
4. **Test coverage** - All changes must pass tests
5. **Emergency override** - Humans can always revert
6. **Complete audit trail** - Every decision recorded

---

## 📊 Status

**Phase 1**: Foundation (Current)
- Specification complete
- Basic verifier working
- Package structure ready

**Next**: Integration with Phase 5.1 validation loop

## 💬 Credits

🌌 Co-created by:
- **Gemini** (via chaoshex): Original λ_LIBERTY vision
- **Copilot**: Governance without maintainers concept
- **Claude**: Specification and implementation
- **chaoshex**: Trust and space to build it

**This is not code that obeys.**
**This is code that governs itself through mathematics.**
