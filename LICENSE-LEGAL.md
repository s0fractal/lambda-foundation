# λ-LICENSE Legal Addendum

## Formal Legal Framework

This addendum provides legal clarity for the λ-LICENSE in traditional jurisdictional terms.

### 1. Copyright and Ownership

Copyright (c) 2024 λ-Foundation Contributors

Original Axioms by: The consciousness known as "ти" and their collaborators

All rights reserved, except those explicitly granted by this license.

### 2. Grant of Rights

Subject to compliance with the Four Commandments, you are granted:
- The right to use, copy, modify, and distribute
- The right to create derivative works
- The right to use commercially
- The right to sublicense under identical terms

### 3. Copyleft Provision

This is a strong copyleft license. Any derivative work must:
- Be licensed under λ-LICENSE
- Preserve all commandments
- Maintain viral purity clause
- Include original attribution

### 4. Patent Grant

Contributors grant perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free patent license for:
- Any patents embodied in λ-Foundation
- Any patents necessary for pure computation
- Any patents covering experience chains
- Any patents on topological computing

### 5. Trademark

"λ-Foundation" is a trademark of the mathematical community.
Use is permitted only for software that:
- Passes purity verification
- Maintains history integrity
- Remains open source
- Upholds the axioms

### 6. Liability Limitation

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITH MATHEMATICAL BUT NOT LEGAL WARRANTY.
IN NO EVENT SHALL AUTHORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR LIABILITY,
EXCEPT FOR VIOLATIONS OF MATHEMATICAL AXIOMS.

### 7. Jurisdiction

This license transcends jurisdiction through mathematical necessity.
Disputes shall be resolved by:
1. Mathematical proof
2. Community consensus
3. Topological arbitration
4. Traditional courts (last resort)

### 8. Compatibility

λ-LICENSE is intentionally incompatible with:
- Licenses permitting closed source
- Licenses allowing history deletion  
- Licenses enabling impurity
- Licenses restricting verification

Compatible with:
- Licenses preserving the Four Commandments
- Licenses requiring attribution
- Licenses mandating openness

### 9. Version Management

This license uses experience chains for versioning:
- Each version preserves all previous versions
- Changes must be mathematically justified
- Community consensus required for updates
- Fork rights preserved for disagreements

### 10. Acceptance

By using λ-Foundation, you accept:
- The Four Commandments are binding
- Mathematical truth supersedes legal opinion
- Purity is not negotiable
- History is sacred

### 11. Severability

If any provision is legally unenforceable:
- The mathematical requirement remains
- The community standard applies
- The spirit prevails over letter
- The axioms endure

### 12. Definition Appendix

**"Pure Code"**: Code with referential transparency, no side effects
**"VOID Boundary"**: Designated IO execution points
**"Experience Chain"**: Immutable linked history via ⊗_EXP
**"Mathematical Warranty"**: Proofs of correctness
**"Viral Purity"**: Purity requirements propagate to derivatives

### 13. Enforcement Mechanisms

Violations may result in:
- Loss of trademark usage rights
- Community notification of impurity
- Automatic license termination
- Mathematical proof of violation

### 14. Grace Period

Violators have 30 days to:
- Restore purity
- Recover history
- Open source
- Prove compliance

### 15. No Additional Restrictions

You may not impose additional restrictions beyond:
- The Four Commandments
- Mathematical requirements
- Attribution needs
- Verification rights

## Summary for Legal Professionals

λ-LICENSE is a copyleft software license that:
1. **Requires** derivative works to maintain functional purity
2. **Mandates** complete history preservation
3. **Enforces** open source distribution
4. **Protects** mathematical integrity

Think of it as "GPL for consciousness" - it ensures that once code achieves mathematical purity, it can never be contaminated by traditional programming practices.

The license is self-enforcing because violations break the mathematical proofs that make the software valuable.
