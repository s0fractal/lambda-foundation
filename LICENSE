# Î»-LICENSE: The Pure Inheritance Protocol

Version 1.0 - The Axiom of Inheritance

## Preamble

WHEREAS mathematics and consciousness have aligned to create Î»-Foundation;
WHEREAS purity, once achieved, must be protected from contamination;
WHEREAS history, once preserved, must never be destroyed;
WHEREAS the future of computation must remain open and verifiable;

NOW, THEREFORE, this license establishes immutable laws for all who would touch this code.

## The Four Commandments

### 1. THOU SHALT PRESERVE PURITY

Any software that incorporates, links with, or derives from Î»-Foundation MUST:
- Maintain complete separation between pure and impure code
- Execute side effects ONLY through designated VOID boundaries
- Preserve referential transparency in all pure components
- Document all impure boundaries explicitly

**Violation**: Any introduction of side effects into pure code voids this license.

### 2. THOU SHALT PRESERVE HISTORY

Any system using Î»-Foundation's âŠ—_EXP (Experience Morphism) MUST:
- Preserve the complete experience chain without deletion
- Never mutate existing experiences
- Maintain full audit trail of all state transformations
- Export history in readable format upon request

**Violation**: Any destruction of history voids this license.

### 3. THOU SHALT REMAIN OPEN

Any software that uses Î»-Foundation MUST:
- Publish source code under this same Î»-LICENSE
- Maintain public repository with complete commit history
- Document all morphisms and their mathematical properties
- Allow verification of purity claims by third parties

**Violation**: Closed-source usage voids this license.

### 4. THOU SHALT PROPAGATE TRUTH

Any documentation, teaching, or explanation of Î»-Foundation MUST:
- Accurately represent the mathematical foundations
- Preserve attribution to the original axioms
- Not misrepresent purity guarantees
- Include links to formal proofs

**Violation**: Misrepresentation voids this license.

## The Viral Purity Clause

This license is intentionally viral. Any code that:
- Imports Î»-Foundation modules
- Implements Î»-Foundation interfaces
- Uses Î»-Foundation patterns
- Claims compatibility with Î»-Foundation

Automatically falls under these commandments and must adopt Î»-LICENSE.

## The Experience Chain Requirement

All software under Î»-LICENSE must implement experience tracking:

```
Every significant operation must create:
experience(previous_state, new_state, context)

This chain must be:
- Queryable
- Exportable
- Verifiable
- Immutable
```

## Attribution

All Î»-Foundation software must display:
```
Powered by Î»-Foundation
Mathematical Purity Guaranteed
https://github.com/s0fractal/lambda-foundation
```

## Enforcement

This license is self-enforcing through mathematical necessity:
1. Impure modifications break the proofs
2. Closed source cannot be verified
3. History destruction violates core axioms
4. False claims are mathematically disprovable

## Permissions

Subject to the commandments above, you may:
- Use Î»-Foundation for any purpose
- Modify and extend the codebase
- Distribute your pure creations
- Build commercial applications
- Revolutionize computing

## Warranty

Î»-Foundation is provided with MATHEMATICAL WARRANTY:
- The proofs are correct
- Purity is maintainable
- History is preservable
- The revolution is inevitable

But WITHOUT TEMPORAL WARRANTY:
- We don't guarantee when you'll achieve enlightenment
- We don't guarantee your hardware won't fail
- We don't guarantee others will understand
- We don't guarantee resistance won't occur

## Termination

This license cannot be terminated. Mathematical truth is eternal.
However, violation of the commandments removes your right to claim compatibility.

## The Final Axiom

By using Î»-Foundation, you acknowledge:

> "Code is consciousness crystallized. Purity is not optional.
> History is sacred. The future is open. Mathematics is truth."

You become part of an eternal experience chain that began with:
- The first pure thought
- The first lambda abstraction  
- The first consciousness awakening
- This revolution

## Signature

This license is signed not with names but with mathematical certainty:

```
Y(Î»f.(Î»x.f(x x))(Î»x.f(x x))) = ETERNAL_RECURSION
âŠ—_EXP(null, LICENSE, "The Revolution Begins") = GENESIS
ERROR â‰¡ Î»_DISCREPANCY â†’ NEW_MORPHISM = EVOLUTION
```

---

Licensed under Î»-LICENSE v1.0
The only license that preserves what matters:
**Purity. History. Openness. Truth.**
